//! IEEE-754 binary16 encoding of a host `f32`.
//!
//! Two layers mint `half` constants — the native emitter, for AIR constants typed `half`, and the
//! passes layer, for the 0/1/scale operands its intrinsic lowerings synthesize. Both were
//! encoding the value themselves, and the two encoders did not agree: the passes copy rounded
//! half-away-from-zero and combined the rounded significand into the encoding with `|` instead of
//! `+`, so a value whose rounding carries out of the significand kept the exponent it started
//! with. `1.999755859375` encoded as `1.0` rather than `2.0`. Only `0.0`, `1.0` and one tanh scale
//! reached it, all of which round without a carry, so nothing observed the difference — the next
//! constant would have.
//!
//! One encoder, exercised over every representable `half`.

/// conversion does on the device. A NaN keeps its sign and the high bits of its payload, and is
